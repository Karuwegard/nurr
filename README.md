# Neovim User Rock Repository (NURR)

The NURR hosts and automatically packages Neovim Luarocks releases for many plugins
whose developers do not want to maintain a Luarocks CI workflow.

This repository contains a CI which runs every 4 hours, enumerating a set of curated Neovim plugins
and publishing them to the `neovim` manifest on `luarocks.org` - this keeps the root manifest clean
and allows the original authors to publish their own plugins if they so choose.

## How it works

Plugins are published using the [luarocks-tag-release](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/luarocks-tag-release)
action.

### Plugins

The plugin metadata are stored in a [plugins.json](./plugins.json) file, which
is currently updated manually.
A [chunk workflow](./.github/workflows/chunk.yml) reads the plugins.json file and 
chunks the plugins into sets of 256 (the max number of outputs per job).
Each chunk is dispatched to an update workflow, 
which uses the chunk it receives as the input for a matrix build.

### Tree-sitter parsers [WIP]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The [tree-sitter-parsers.json](./tree-sitter-parsers.json) file is
> generated by [a github workflow](./.github/workflows/update-ts-parsers.yml).
